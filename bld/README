The bld/serial and bld/parallel are separate build directories intended 
for use for building serial programs (without MPI) and parallel programs
(with MPI). The setup script installs a separate set of configuration 
and makefile files in each build directory.

Compile time options for code built in each build directory may be set 
by cd'ing to a specific build directory (serial/ or parallel/) and 
invoking the configure script from that directory with appropriate 
command line options. Changes in the configuration of one build 
directory have no effect upon the other. See the html documentation 
for further information about how to use the configure script to 
enable or disable specific features.
