For configuration files:

   1) Add Simp::Species::writeStructure function to write structure 
      for a species to file in format used by SmpConfigIo.
      (Done)

   2) SmpConfigIo for McMd. (Done)

   3) Add Simp::Species::readStructure function to read information 
      in the same format and initialize a new species.

   4) Add an array of Simp::Species objects to DdMd::Simulation, and
      int nSpecies() and bool hasSpecies() functions.

   5) Write SmpConfigReader in DdMd that optionally reads Species
      information. This class should also generate bond information
      from the Species information and send this all processors.

   6) Write a SmpConfigWriter in DdMd that writes Species information
      if available.

For trajectory files:

   1) Write SmpTrajectoryWriter class for DdMd.

   2) Write trajectory file reader and writer classes for McMd.

   Issues: How to deal with molecular format that only includes
   a subset of the atoms in the simulation.

For topology / species structure file, if any:

   Proposal: Topology file format is identical to that used in SPECIES 
   block of a configuration file.

Force field file:

   Consider creating another ForceField file format to allow 
   communication of potential energy parameters and atom labelling 
   schemes between programs.

   The force field would have to contain names of the styles used
   for each type of interaction.

   Provide mechanism for McMd and DdMd programs to read in the 
   force field before reading in remaining parameters of the 
   potential energy, and then use the stored force field information
   to initialize parameters.

   Create or reuse a standard container for passing parameters for 
   a bond, etc. to a potential or interaction class. The information
   is just an array of numbers, so it could use an existing array 
   type or a new class. The potential problems are when a style
   requires information that is common to all group type Ids and
   is not contained in the name, or when it requires per groupId
   information that is not naturally encoded as a real number.
