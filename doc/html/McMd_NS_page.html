">McPairPotential</a> and <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdPairPotential.html" title="An PairPotential for MD simulation. ">MdPairPotential</a> provide slightly different interfaces for nonbonded pair interactions for use in MC and MD simulations, respectively. Every potential class provides an energy() method that returns the associated energy for the entire system. The covalent potential energy classes (<a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1BondPotential.html" title="Abstract Bond Potential class. ">BondPotential</a>, <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1AnglePotential.html" title="Interface for a Angle Interaction.

">DihedralPotential</a>) and the <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdPairPotential.html" title="An PairPotential for MD simulation. ">MdPairPotential</a> class all provide an addForces() method that adds the contribution of the associated type of interaction to the atomic forces for every atom in the system. The covalent potential energy classes and <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1McPairPotential.html" title="A PairPotential for MC simulations (abstract). ">McPairPotential</a> all provide an atomEnergy() method that returns the value of a particular energy contribution (i.e., the nonbonded pair energy or covalent bond energy) for a specific atom, for use in MC algorithms.</p>
<p>The "potential" classes discussed above are abstract base classes. An implementation of each of the potential energy classes is provided by an associated class template. Each such potential energy template takes one of the Interaction classes defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceSimp.html" title="Classes used by all simpatico molecular simulations. ">Simp</a> namespace as a template argument, and has an instance of that Interaction class as a private member. The name of each template is obtained by adding the suffix "Impl" (for "implementation") to the name of the parent abstract potential class. Thus, for example, MdPairPotentialImpl&lt;LJPair&gt; is a concrete subclass of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdPairPotential.html" title="An PairPotential for MD simulation. ">MdPairPotential</a> for Lennard-Jones pair interactions, which uses an instance of the <a class="el" href="classSimp_1_1LJPair.html" title="A cutoff, shifted Lennard-Jones nonbonded pair interaction. ">Simp::LJPair</a> interaction class to calculate pair energies and forces for individual nonbonded pairs of atoms.</p>
<p>This use of templates to implement potential energies was chosen in order to allow the user to choose a form of each potential energy at run time without sacrificing efficiency, and without redundant code. Because the interaction class methods are not virtual, this design allows each template to implement an inner loop for force or energy calculations that is free of virtual function calls, and allows the compiler to inline many force and energy interaction functions.</p>
<p>The choice of which interaction class to use for each type of potential energy is specified in the parameter file by the string parameters pairStyle, BondStyle, etc. The value of each such "style" variable is the name of the desired interaction class. For example, specifying a "pairStyle" to be "LJPair" in an MD program instructs the program to construct and use an instance of MdPairPotentialImpl&lt;LJPair&gt;.</p>

">System</a> will maintain a record of which molecules are currently in that system. The main simulation loop was implemented in the parent <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Simulation.html" title="The main object in a simulation, which coordinates others.
